Convergence Analysis for MLSDC
==============================

This project investigates the impact of the convergence results described in the paper "Convergence Analysis for Multi-level Spectral Deferred Corrections".
We use Auzinger's equation and Van der Pol's oscillator as well as the 1D heat equation to show how MLSDC converges for a linear/non-linear ODE and a linear PDE.
